	Abstract = {This paper considers a type of orthogonal range query, called orthogonal range successor query, which is defined as follows: Let P be a set of n points that lie on an n ×n grid. Then, for any given rectangle R, our target is to report, among all points of P ∩ R, the point which has the smallest y-coordinate. We propose two indexing data structures for P so that online orthogonal range successor queries are supported efficiently. The first one is a succinct index where only O(n) words are allowed for the index space. We show that each query can be answered in O(logn / loglogn) time, thus improving the best-known O(logn) time by M{\"a}kinen and Navarro. The improvement stems from the design of an index with O(1) query time when the points are restricted to lie on a narrow grid, which in turn extends the recent wavelet tree technique to support the desired query. Our second result is a general framework for indexing points in the d-dimensional grids. We show an O(n 1 + ε )-space index that supports each d-dimensional query in optimal O(1) time. Our second index is very simple and when d = 2, it is as efficient as the existing index by Crochemore et al.},

	Abstract = {The most important first step in understanding next-generation sequencing data is the initial alignment or assembly that determines whether an experiment has succeeded and provides a first glimpse into the results. In parallel with the growth of new sequencing technologies, several algorithms that align or assemble the large data output of today's sequencing machines have been developed. We discuss the current algorithmic approaches and future directions of these fundamental tools and provide specific examples for some commonly used tools.},
