\section{Conclusion}

From this we have shown that\ldots{} 1. The table expands too
rapidly to make increasing the arity worthwhile 2. There are simple
ways to implement Multiary Wavelet Trees using rank structures for
binary alphabets. 3. This is faster, but no longer smaller than the
original text. 4. Utilising a binary RRR has better compression
than SDArray for this purpose.

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Investigate if there is any way to make the count table smaller, or
  if a more efficient implementation could make it worthwhile\ldots{}
  or if there is some way to utilise sparsity.
\item
  Implement a multi-ary huffman shaped wavelet tree
\end{itemize}
