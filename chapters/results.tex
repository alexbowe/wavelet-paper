\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\emph{Note that measurements for the Generalized RRR with arity 16 are missing, 
since the experiments took too long due to paging. This supports our third 
hypothesis, but there may be ways to overcome this, as detailed in Section 
\ref{sec:future}.}

\emph{Also Note that the Uncompressed Wavelet Tree timings have been plotted on 
a different graph due to the difference in scale.}\\

From Figure \ref{fig:unique} we can see how the number of unique classes and 
block permutations increases depending on file size and arity. Table 
\ref{tab:maxclass} shows the maximum of each of these values, and Figure 
\label{fig:sparse} plots the number of unique classes and block permutations as
a percentage of the values in Table \ref{tab:maxclass}.

Figure \ref{fig:sparse} indicates that in all data sets, around $100$ percent of
the classes and block permutations were encountered for arity 2. In most data
sets, all classes were encountered for arity 4 as well, with the exception being 
DNA, which encountered around $30$ percent.

Figure \ref{fig:unique} shows that the proteins data set had significantly more
unique block permutations than any other data set, while the words data set is 
the only one to have encountered all classes for arity 8.

From Figure \ref{fig:stime-eng} we can see how increasing the arity affects
querying a non-compressed Wavelet Tree. It is slower for increasing file size
because it is calculating rank queries without the assistance of RRR.

From Figures \ref{fig:time-eng-25-50} and \ref{fig:time-eng-75} we are able 
to see that increasing the file size does not significantly affect the time
performance of the Wavelet Trees which utilise RRR.

The Generalised RRR is slower than Claude's. We suspect that this is due to our 
use of pointers, as required to create a sparse table, whereas Claude's avoids 
dereferencing and may make better use of cache. The trend is similar to the
other Multiary Wavelet Trees, though.

The Multi-Binary RRR Wavelet Tree is faster than Claude's when the arity is 
increased. It is slower at arity 2 possibly due to optimisations in Claude's
Wavelet Tree code, or because we need to do an extra calculation to work out
the binary rank of all previous symbols (see Section 
\ref{sec:multi-bin-rrr}).

All other time graphs show similar trends, and so have been omitted\footnote{The 
other graphs are available at http://github.com/alexbowe/honours-thesis/}.

Figure \ref{fig:mem-eng-75} shows how changing the arity affects the memory
consumption of the structures. We only show this for the 75MB file, as the 
others compress (or expand) with similar coefficients. Note that even though 
the generalised RRR structure's Wavelet Tree (which includes the RRR sequences 
it stores) is smaller than the original text, the size to contain the supporting 
RRR count structure is very large.

The large size of the RRR Table for the Generalised RRR in Figure 
\ref{fig:mem-prot-75} appears to be the result of the large number of unique
permutations encountered for the Proteins file, since it has less classes but 
more permutations than the words file. See Tables .. and \ref{tab:maxclass}.
