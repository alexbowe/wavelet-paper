\section{Experiments}

Hypotheses...

1000 random rank queries $rank(c, i)$ were generated, with $i elementof [0, 
N-1]$ and $c elementof SIGMA$.

We used Francisco Claude's
implementation as a base-line. We used the same default block-size and
super-block-size as Claude.

The experiments were run on Mac OS X Snow Leopard with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2
Duo processor, and 4GB 1067 MHz DDR3 RAM.

The data set is described below\footnote{The BWT files for each dataset are 
available at\\ http://bwt-corpus.s3.amazonaws.com/list.html, and are 
reconstructible using the scripts at http://github.com/alexbowe/bwt-corpus}.

\subsection{Data}
Since Wavelet Trees are used to provide faster rank queries on BWTs, we
constructed BWT strings over a selection of texts taken from the \emph{Pizza\&Chili}
Corpus website\footnote{http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl}. This is the standard
corpus used when developing compressed self indexes, and has been collected by
Paolo Ferragina and Gonzalo Navarro, two prominent contributors of suffix array 
research.

The corpus consists of source code for the Linux kernel and GNU C Compiler
(GCC), protein sequences, DNA, English texts from Project
Gutenberg\footnote{http://www.gutenberg.org}, and XML-formatted bibliographies
of from several major Computer Science journals. These are considered to be
representative of the sort of problems a suffix array may be used for. In the 
case of the English corpus, we also took a word-based integer mapping, allowing 
us to test word-based indexing.

Three sizes to test the scalability: 25MB, 50MB and 75MB. These were selected as 
to not be in cache entirely, but not take large amounts of time
for experimentation. The length and alphabet size of these files are described 
in Table \ref{tab:files}.
