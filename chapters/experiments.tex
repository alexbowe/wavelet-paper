\section{Experiments}

Hypotheses\ldots{}

1000 random rank queries $rank(c, i)$ were generated, with
$i elementof [0, N-1]$ and $c elementof SIGMA$.

We used Francisco Claude's implementation as a base-line. We used
the same default block-size and super-block-size as Claude.

The experiments were run on Mac OS X Snow Leopard with a 2.4 GHz
Intel Core 2 Duo processor, and 4GB 1067 MHz DDR3 RAM.

The data set is described below.

\item
  25, 50, 75
\item
  in the case of the english corpus, we also took the word-based
  integer mapping.
\item
  Then took the BWT transform of each of these.
