Self-index data structures for pattern matching based on Suffix
Arrays and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform have recently grown
popular. The fundamental operation in these self-indexes is the rank query: 
$rank(i, c)$ requests the number of occurrences of symbol $c$ before position 
$i$ in a string. The \emph{wavelet 
tree} is currently the data structure of choice for implementing rank 
queries. Current wavelet tree implementations encode the Burrows-Wheeler 
Transform as a hierarchy of binary strings, which they then store as RRR 
sequences;
the RRR structure offers $O(1)$ rank queries and zeroth-order entropy 
compression for 
binary strings. A generalisation of the RRR tecnique extends wavelet trees to 
have higher 
order encoding, that is, increased branching, in theory making traversal faster. 
To support the implementation of such a multiary
wavelet tree, this thesis investigates the generalisation of RRR to sequences 
over small alphabets. We also analyse the use of concatenated bitmaps to 
represent sequences over small alphabets, thus allowing continued use of the
binary RRR structure. Our results show that multiary wavelet trees are faster
than their binary counterparts, but require large amounts of memory in the 
case of the generalised RRR. We also show binary RRR on concatenated bitmaps to 
be an effective, practical alternative.
